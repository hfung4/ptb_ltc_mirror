* The bronze.py performs the following tasks in certain data projects:
* Ingest Data from external data storage such as AWS S3, Azure Blob, dbfs, or external databases.
* Register the data as a delta table (abstract representation of the underlying data in e.g., AWS S3) in the hive metastore (HMS)
or Unity Catalog (UC).
* Infer or apply a schema to the raw data for consistent downstream processing.
