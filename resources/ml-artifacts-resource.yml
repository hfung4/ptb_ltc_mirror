# Model and Optimized Model Experiment deployment

# This YAML file is used in the Databricks Asset Bundle to create and configure assets,
# specifically models and experiments, while defining access permissions for these resources.
# It specifies key properties for each asset, such as the model's name, description.

# Allow users to read the experiment (use user_group or user_name which must be .thrivent.com emails)
